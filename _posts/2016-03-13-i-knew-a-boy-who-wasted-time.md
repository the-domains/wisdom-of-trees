I
knew a boy who wasted time

On
foolishness and useless rhyme

I
heard him say he thought that trees could talk

Well
if they did what would it mean

To
hear beyond the day's routine

I'm
not sure we'd take the time to stop

...
to listen

But
in these branches live our dreams

Wild
ideas and crazy schemes

The
wisdom of a million fruitful years

Love
unfolds in gentle leaves

Revealing
truth that lies beneath

Protecting
all the souls that we hold dear

If
only we could see our way clear

to
listen...

It seems that listening's lost its style

We haven't stopped in quite awhile

To smell the sweetness in a rose

If we can't see and we won't hear

Long enough to face our fears

We can't learn what trees would have us know

Now
the boy is grown and wise

He's
learned to live with compromise

Looking
back on life and taking stock

He
thinks of what his life's been missing

Knows
if he just tries to listen

Late
at night the trees will start to talk

The
wind will blow and trees will softly talk

Will
we listen?

listen...
